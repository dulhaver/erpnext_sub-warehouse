1. Warehouse must either be a `Group` or not.
2. you can not put any item into a Warehouse marked as `Group`. This is rather a logical unit that can contain other `Groups` or actual `Warehouses`.
   - so, you can not put a box with items on the Floor of a physical Warehouse, unless you have made a Child name "Floor" to the Warehouse Group
